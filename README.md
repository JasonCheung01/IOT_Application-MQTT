# IoT Application

IoT Application is a project that explores IoT tools and technologies for possible integration into a robotics project.

## What is IoT?

IoT, otherwise known as the Internet of Thing, is a network that describes physical objects (that are embedded with sensors, softwares, and other technologies) for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices or systems over the internet.

## Why IoT?

It is one of the most important technologies used today in our century. Almost everything that we used today - such as cars, refrigerators, and thermostats - can connect to the internet which can allow seamless communication between people, processes, and things. As a result, to explore the potential of IoT tools we will investigate methods using an ESP32/8266 board along with the concept of MQTT.

# Prerequisites

- Installation of Arduino IDE 1.6.8 or greater
- Installation of ESP32/8266 Board Package towards Arduino IDE
- Installation of Mosquitto MQTT and Python Paho MQTT

# Installing IoT Application
